# Thoughts on the Vermona Kick Lancet

I've been producing music for few years now and I've always been attracted to nice pieces of gear: that is gear that *sounds well*. One thing is certain: when it comes to sounding good, the *Kick Lancet* sounds really good.

## But wait, what is the Kick Lancet ?

The Kick Lancet is a fully analogue bass drum (*aka* "kick") generator. It offers various knobs to tune the bass drum to taste. The Kick Lancet aim to synthetize a classic 808 kick drum, and without to much tuning, you can get a super satisfying 808 kick.

One particularity of the Kick Lancet is that you can also use it to generate uncommon kick drums, with for example the ability to use FM Modulation on the kick (FM INT and FM Freq knobs). This can lead to surprising sound effects and sound design tricks as well as super cheesy-sounding kicks.

This little box may look inoffensive but trust me, it sounds vary big.
