# Thoughts on the Vermona Kick Lancet

I've been producing music for few years now and I've always been attracted to nice pieces of gear: that is gear that *sounds well*. One thing is certain: when it comes to sounding good, the *Kick Lancet* sounds really good.

## But wait, what is the Kick Lancet ?

The Kick Lancet is a fully analogue bass drum (*aka* "kick") generator. It offers various knobs to tune the bass drum to taste. The Kick Lancet aim to synthetize a classic 808 kick drum, and without to much tuning, you can get a super satisfying 808 kick.

One particularity of the Kick Lancet is that you can also use it to generate uncommon kick drums, with for example the ability to use FM Modulation on the kick (FM INT and FM Freq knobs). This can lead to surprising sound effects and sound design tricks as well as super cheesy-sounding kicks.

This little box may look inoffensive but trust me, it sounds vary big.

## Designing techno kicks with the Kick Lancet

Most of the music I produce today is Hard-techno music. In techno, the kick is the starting point of the groove, and sometimes (like in hardtechno music) it's even the most important element of the music. Having a unique, good sounding hard kick is therefor very important for this style of music.

I personnally love to shape my kicks during hours until I got something that I like, or at least something that I think sound good enough. Sometimes, I start my musics by a session of sound design for a Kick, and then instantly create a groove around it until I got a music I can listen to and that I'm happy with.

In that regard, the Kick Lancet was a game changer for me: that's litteraly the easiest way I got for designing kicks. Before the Kick Lancet, I used to play around with some VSTs like [Kick2](https://www.sonicacademy.com/products/kick-2) or with *samples*, then adding tons of processing over it. It does the job too, but if I have to be honest, the kicks I've made with the Kick Lancet are on an other level of sound design and power. It just sound good.

The fact that I can physically turn knobs to get the sound I want is (at least for me) also more entertaining, and push me to go wilder on sound exploration.

I'm not a "analogue-only" guy though: I still uses lots of VSTs to build my effects chain over the kicks I produce with the Kick Lancet.

## A negative point of the Kick Lancet

After almost one year of intensive use of the Kick Lancet, I can tell that the build quality is very good (Dutch qualidad!). The biggest problem I had with the Kick lancet is it's "Pitch" knob which control the overall pitch of the kick.

The problem with it is that it's very sensitive and for **bass** drums (that must hit under *200Hz*) it's sometimes very difficult to reach the exact pitch we need for the kick. For instance, I rarely turn the Knob higher than the first quarter when I'm designing kicks.

Of course this problem can become a "feature" when it comes to sound design. But this is a kick drum generator, not a SFX generator. Sometimes I wish this knob could be less sensitive, sometimes I'm happy with it.

## Would I recommend it ?

If you're interested into getting some analogue gear, and that you're obsessed with your kicks, then I just have one thing to say: go for it. You'll not regret it. It's a super piece of gear and it's my "goto" for techno music. One thing super cool that I don't have talked about yet is that you can even trigger the Kick using a Trigger signal. That means that you can use any drum machine and trigger the Kick Lancet for your Kicks.
